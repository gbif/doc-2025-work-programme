=== Activity 4.2: Enhance support services for data publishers and users

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* The expanding GBIF community of users are fully supported by a responsive help desk team and improved technical documentation
* The taxonomic and collections communities benefit from improvements in GBIF support to the https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll[Global Registry of Scientific Collections^] (GRSciColl) and the Catalogue of Life

==== Indicative tasks for 2025

* Mature processes around the ticketing system to managing help desk requests, broadening to train and include regional and thematic contractors
* Phase out global use of GBIF backbone, support migration of identifiers, and provide guidelines for contributing taxonomic data to the Catalogue of Life
* Explore opportunities to connect with emerging systems that publish Digital Extended specimen data
* Support content curation on GRSciColl, coordinate editor and user communities, and improve data processes as outlined in the https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/road-map[current GRSciColl roadmap^]
* Expand the newly established https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/[technical documentation site^] with clearer guidelines relating to data quality, data-publishing processes and data formatting, including those related to the use of controlled vocabularies

** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: Core funds: salaried staff, contractors; Supplementary funds: Special Purpose Fund;  potential EC grant and GEF-8 funds. 

[[activity4-3]]
=== Activity 4.3: Enhance features and capabilities of the GBIF infrastructure

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* Improved user interface to GBIF.org
* Improved capabilities for GBIF to handle ecological, collections, and phylogenetic data
* Data reuse increased through more stable GBIF identifiers

==== Indicative tasks for 2025

* Release new versions of GBIF.org and hosted portal software that provide equivalent functionality and use the same software stack 
* Collect and address feedback from the open pilot phase of the eDNA Publishing Tool to prepare it for wider use
* Explore feasibility of enabling services to search for occurrences within eDNA datasets using sequences and taxa to which the sequence aligns  (see also <activity-1-3,§1.3>)
* Explore the collaborative development of a tool to publish phylogenetic trees with associated information, such as the material and related sequences
* Advance capabilities for event-based search, based on prototype co-developed with the Atlas of Living Australia, and explore support for the Humboldt Extension for Ecological Inventories (see also <activity-1-2,§1.2> and <activity-4-4,§4.4>)
* Start improving the representation of marine data in GBIF.org as outlined in the https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-e52v-5875[OBIS-GBIF 2024 Joint Action Plan for Marine Biodiversity Data^]
* Improve ability for users to filter data based on categories of dataset origins, including citizen science, eDNA and the business sector (see also <activity-2-4,§2.4>)
* Document recommendations for completing metadata and using stable identifiers for individuals (e.g. ORCID iDs), organizations (e.g. ROR IDs) and funders (e.g. OpenFunderRegistry IDs), and index fields to enable aggregate views (see also <activity-1-1,§1.1>)
* Explore implementation of outcomes from the task group on Indigenous data governance, such as adopting https://localcontexts.org/[Local Context labels^] at suitable levels within the GBIF infrastructure (see also <activity-3-2,§3.2>)
* Improve data quality by
** Integrating basic data quality checks into the IPT and implementing emerging publishing models and changes to Darwin Core
** Streamlining the processes developed for ensuring occurrenceID stability
** Continuing to explore approaches to annotation capabilities in GBIF.org focused on taxonomic and geographic combinations 
* Explore alternative platforms and methods for integrating and managing information from literature tracking

** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: Core funds: salaried staff; Supplementary funds: EC grant funding; potential EC grant and GEF-8 funds.

=== Activity 4.4: Drive data standards development

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* The revised GBIF data model is matured and applicable for use
* All controlled terms used in GBIF processing are managed in the vocabulary server

==== Indicative tasks for 2025

* Mature publishing model(s) for use,  start preparing technical and user documentation, and release an initial update to the Darwin Core Archive data format that satisfies https://www.gbif.org/new-data-model#_case-studies[case studies^] relating to Materials, Interactions, and Surveys and Monitoring (see also <activity-1-2,§1.2> and <activity-4-3,§4.3>).
* Establish a TDWG task group under the https://www.tdwg.org/community/dwc/[Darwin Core Maintenance Group^], proposing the addition of high-level, habitat-relevant terms (Realm, Biome) and associated controlled vocabularies
* Continue to accommodate newly interested communities  as part of the data model investigation
* Continue to mature the unified data model and prepare it as a candidate standard within https://www.tdwg.org/[Biodiversity Information Standards^] (TDWG)
* Complete data-processing changes required to ensure all vocabularies are read from the vocabulary server
** Address the specific needs outlined in feedback from the Paleontology community 
** Evaluate workflows for involving the volunteer translator community
* Support the work of vocabulary contributors and lead further vocabulary development

** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: Core funds: salaried staff; Supplementary funds: EC grant funding;  potential EC grant and GEF-8 funds.
