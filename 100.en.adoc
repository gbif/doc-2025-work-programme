== Priority Area 1: Science and Research

*_Improving biodiversity evidence for scientific research and understanding_*

[[activity1-1]]
=== Activity 1.1: Drive mobilization and use of biodiversity data to support priority thematic areas of relevance

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

*	Knowledge gaps are reduced by consolidating data coverage across the thematic areas of relevance
*	GBIF’s relevance to research is enhanced, through increased recognition and uptake of GBIF mediated data among researchers across additional scientific disciplines

==== Indicative tasks for 2025

*	Complete and coordinate publication of the peer-reviewed systematic review of GBIF-enabled research to identify usage trends in 2020–2024 to help prioritize outreach to thematic communities; 
* Coordinate preparation and publication of a collection of peer-reviewed papers describing key elements of the GBIF network and infrastructure
* Engage high-priority thematic communities based on recommendations from the Science Committee and establish new consultations with with subject experts, data holders, data users and other stakeholders on agrobiodiversity and biodiversity loss) including 
* Cultivate and support discussions, knowledge exchange and engagement with and within thematic communities, both existing and new; ensure continued flows of data and up-to-date guidance; explore options for wider thematic reporting and discoverability
* Consolidate data flows relating to vectors of human diseases through the https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2022/04/inv021972[Vector Atlas^] project, EFSA's One Health / VectorNet collaboration; and updates of VectorBase while implementing  recommendations from the the https://www.gbif.org/news/4jj1iKMn5llVnM6cUr8Y2m/[GBIF task group on vectors of human diseases^] 
* Explore the usability and accessibility of the GBIF infrastructure for researchers, initiate discussion with all stakeholders and provide recommendations for improvements to tools and processes

*** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: Core funds: salaried staff, workshops and travel; Supplementary funds: https://www.gatesfoundation.org/[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation^]

=== Activity 1.2: Advance GBIF’s contribution to latest biodiversity modelling approaches

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* GBIF supports the evolution of fundamental data-driven biodiversity research and its application across methods, scales and disciplines in life and environmental sciences

==== Indicative tasks for 2025

* Complete prototype digital twins dependent on and coordinated by GBIF through partnership on https://biodt.eu/[BioDT^]report and disseminate lessons learnedContinue engagement and showcase representation of sampling-event data through GBIF; scale up data flows from ecological research, survey and monitoring data communities; improve and expand interoperability with partner infrastructures; and run workshops that broaden data publishing models and produce example datasets
* Run a data republication campaign to convert existing occurrence datasets and increase its value through use of the https://eco.tdwg.org/[Humboldt Extension for Ecological Inventories^]; develop tools and strategies for encouraging holders of survey and monitoring datasets not yet in GBIF to share them 
* Contribute to development and updating of documentation, templates and training materials for publishing and accessing survey and monitoring data through GBIF

*** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: Core funds: salaried staff, workshops and travel; Supplementary funds: EC grant; potential EC grant and GEF-8 funds

[[activity1-3]]
=== Activity 1.3: Improve taxonomic balance and interoperability of biodiversity evidence in GBIF through DNA-derived nomenclatures, metabarcoding and eDNA data

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* Knowledge gaps are reduced by consolidating data coverage across the thematic areas of relevance
GBIF’s relevance to research is enhanced, through increased recognition and uptake of GBIF-mediated data among researchers across additional scientific disciplines

==== Indicative tasks for 2025

* Continue engagement and improve coverage and quality of data representation in GBIF from metabarcoding research and eDNA monitoring, expand interoperability with partner infrastructures
* Improve and update guidance materials for data publishing and develop guidance for accessing DNA-derived data through GBIF
* Strengthen collaborations with barcoding communities and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) libraries
* Lead experiment towards an index of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)
* Analyse feasibility of a standard format for DNA-reference datasets capable of crediting taxonomic data holders for use of OTU names

*** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: Core funds: salaried staff, workshops and travel; Supplementary funds: EC grant; potential EC grant and GEF-8 funds. 

[[activity1-ongoing]]
=== Ongoing activities to support science and research

* Explore and document data originator and data user needs in the GBIF network, across DNA data infrastructures, and in the eDNA community, including needs of international and national initiatives, of organizations, and of individual researchers
* Build, develop and consult around survey and monitoring data to assess and understand community needs for sampling-event data 
* Support community standards development for priority data areas—such as invasive and alien species, interactions, survey and monitoring data, and DNA—through TDWG and other standards platforms
* Communicate progress with DNA-derived, survey and monitoring, and other thematic communities to the GBIF network and partners
* Maintain GBIF’s literature tracking programme to document and communicate the use of GBIF-mediated data in research 
* Promote best practices in data citation using digital object identifiers (DOIs), through outreach to researchers and journal publishers
* Highlight and illustrate uses of GBIF-mediated data across scientific disciplines and thematic areas through GBIF.org and the annual Science Review
* Increase academic visibility of data and of GBIF contributions of individuals, organizations (including funders) and projects within GBIF.org through the use of  relevant infrastructures  (e.g. https://orcid.org/[ORCID^], https://ror.org/[Research Organization Registry^] (ROR), https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/[Open Funder Registry ^](OFR))
* Capture needs and suggestions from research communities regarding the development of the GBIF data model
* Ensure presence of GBIF representatives— including through Secretariat and node staff, regional contractors — at relevant scientific conferences with appropriate communication materials, presentations and training workshops
* Run annual competitions through the https://www.gbif.org/ebbe[Ebbe Nielsen Challenge^] and https://www.gbif.org/graduate-researchers-award[Graduate Researchers Awards^]
* Support GBIF network to integrate data and GBIF training into higher education programmes
* Keep GBIF’s compliance with FAIR principles for scientific data management and stewardship under continuous review, with appropriate communication and certification for relevant projects and processes
* Review and process datasets reported through the https://github.com/gbif/data-mobilization[Suggest a dataset tool^] to increase ingestion of thematic data into GBIF
