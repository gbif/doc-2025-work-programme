*_Improving biodiversity evidence for scientific research and understanding_*

[[activity1-1]]
=== Activity 1.1: Drive mobilization and use of biodiversity data to support priority thematic areas of relevance

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

*	Knowledge gaps are reduced by consolidating data coverage across the thematic areas of relevance
*	GBIF’s relevance to research is enhanced, through increased recognition and uptake of GBIF mediated data among researchers across additional scientific disciplines

==== Indicative tasks for 2024

*	Commission an update to the systematic review of GBIF use in research (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2018093118[Heberling et al. 2021^]) to identify trends in research uses for the 2020-2024 periods, deepen the analysis of methods and analytical approaches, and inform future support for priority thematic areas of relevance 
* Advance collaborative activities across priority thematic areas of relevance based on recommendations from the Science Committee, including https://www.gbif.org/news/5z5ZYdbhG5CznrQjTZdKg7/gbif-ramps-up-support-of-information-needed-to-tackle-invasive-alien-species[establishing a task group on invasive alien species^] and engaging experts in agrobiodiversity
* Strengthen and expand support and guidance on mobilizing DNA-derived data from a range of data holder types and scales, supported by data quality improvements, improved coverage of DNA-detected organisms in the GBIF taxonomic backbone, and alignment of guidance with the new GBIF data model
* Expand data flows relating to vectors of human disease, in particular malaria-related data through GBIF partnership in the https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2022/04/inv021972[Vector Atlas^] project, with additional data streams on non-malaria vectors as recommended by the https://www.gbif.org/news/4jj1iKMn5llVnM6cUr8Y2m/[GBIF task group on vectors of human diseases^]

*** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: Salaried staff time apart from: external contract for systematic review update (€20,000 core funds); external contracts for priority thematic areas of relevance (€20,000 core funds, possible supplementary funds); contract for expanding data flows on human disease vectors (supplementary funds: https://www.gatesfoundation.org/[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation^] through the Vector Atlas project)

[[activity1-2]]
=== Activity 1.2: Advance GBIF’s contribution to latest biodiversity modelling approaches

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* GBIF supports the evolution of fundamental data-driven biodiversity research and its application across methods, scales and disciplines in life and environmental sciences

==== Indicative tasks for 2024

* Consolidate prototype digital twins dependent on and coordinated by GBIF through partnership on https://biodt.eu/[BioDT^], support user-group testing of prototype twins and links to key biodiversity data infrastructures, and build connections between projects and initiatives through shared data and service dependencies (such as https://pureportal.inbo.be/en/projects/b-cubed-biodiversity-building-blocks-for-policy[B-Cubed^])
* Improve GBIF’s capabilities to manage ecological data streams from key infrastructures and monitoring programmes, applying new data model to accommodate richer data (including absences based on complete species inventories) while designing data flows and outputs in planned workshop on the https://www.tdwg.org/community/osr/humboldt-extension/[TDWG Humboldt Extension^] (see also activities 4.3 and 4.4)

*** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: Salaried staff apart from: travel costs for Digital Twin activities (supplementary funds: https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en[Horizon Europe^] (BioDT); workshop costs for managing ecological data streams (€20,000 core funds, possible supplementary funds from https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/[Cornell Lab for Ornithology^] ) 

[[activity1-ongoing]]
=== Ongoing activities to support science and research

* Maintain GBIF’s literature tracking programme to document and communicate the use of GBIF-mediated data in research (€10,000 from core funding for DataCite fee)
* Promote best practices in data citation using digital object identifiers (DOIs), through outreach to researchers and journal publishers
* Highlight and illustrate uses of GBIF-mediated data across scientific disciplines and thematic areas through GBIF.org and the annual https://www.gbif.org/science-review[Science Review^]
* Continue engagement with thematic communities prioritized in previous Work Programme (soil and freshwater); keep priority thematic relevance areas under regular review, based on outcomes achieved and on advice of the Science Committee and expert groups convened for this purpose
* Capture needs and suggestions from research communities regarding the development of the GBIF data model
* Ensure presence of GBIF representatives—including through Secretariat and node staff, regional contractors and Open Biodiversity Data Ambassadors—at relevant scientific conferences with appropriate communication materials, presentations and training workshops
* Run annual competitions through the https://www.gbif.org/article/1G82GL7jw08kS0g6k6MuSa/[Ebbe Nielsen Challenge^] and https://www.gbif.org/article/44SftFORi0A6mwGK4sgAKW/[Graduate Researchers Awards^](€20,000 from core funding in 2024)
*	Work with partners to maintain and improve support for academic programmes in use of open biodiversity data
*	Keep GBIF’s compliance with FAIR principles for scientific data management and stewardship under continuous review, with appropriate communication and certification for relevant projects and processes
