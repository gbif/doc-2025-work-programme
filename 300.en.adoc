=== Activity 3.2: Support and strengthen GBIF nodes

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* GBIF nodes provide a strong and stable foundation for data mobilization and use through the network

==== Indicative tasks for 2025

* Organize the second Node Awards programme, building on lessons learned from its first year 
* Working with the NSG, scope a series of engagement and training events for nodes within the context of the Global Nodes Meeting and Training, GB32 and Datos Vivos/Living Data 2025 conference
* Organize an in-person knowledge exchange meeting for all members of the regional support teams alongside the Global Nodes Meeting to align their services to the work of the national nodes and GBIF Secretariat 
* Support the work of a task group on Indigenous data governance, including an in-person event alongside the Global Nodes Meeting and Training to facilitate discussion with the nodes
* Develop additional modules for the node development curriculum, based on consultation with the nodes community
* Roll out an updated capacity self-assessment tool for nodes based on review in 2024
* Request community feedback to inform updates to the nodes guidance documents
* Support participation by the nodes community in piloting tools and processes that emerge from the work on the new data model
* Following the regional engagement meeting held in 2024, organize a virtual course on GBIF formal Participation and establishing participant nodes for the Arab States

=== Activity 3.3: Develop capacity and skills

==== Projected outcomes for 2027

* Additional training and guidance resources are available to the community in multiple languages covering both data mobilization and data use

==== Indicative tasks for 2025

* Launch calls for project proposals for the BID programme in the target regions, including (at minimum) Africa, Pacific and Caribbean 
* Maintain and consolidate the existing regional support teams to complement the work of nodes
* Develop and implement induction plan for new members of the BID regional support teams, ensuring the overall coordination and alignment of their work with GBIF Strategic framework and Nodes implementation plan
* In alignment with regional priorities and the BID programme objectives, update and translate materials within GBIF training courses 
* Monitor the implementation of the new format developed for the GBIF Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (CESP) in 2024 and collate and document best practices for CESP call in 2025
* Explore the use of capacity self-assessments in tracking progress across all levels (individual, institutional, national and regional) of the capacity development framework 

** *Expected funding mechanisms and sources*: ore funds: salaried staff,  CESP grant funds and travel; Supplementary funds: EC BID grant; contributions from Norway and Finland to Priority Area 3 Special Purpose Fund; potential funding from the https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/amazon-sustainable-landscapes-program[World Bank Amazon Sustainable Landscapes programme^].
